## 2.2 VLAN Managed Switch

TODO

### NETGEAR GS305E Gigabit Managed Switch

This device is only necessary for `relay` and `gateway` nodes.

We configured the ESPRESSObin to have only one `wan` port. Babel needs to distinguish different network interfaces in order to compute route metrics between the different links and make routing decisions accordingly. So we will make virtual interfaces by tagged each mesh radio with a different VLAN ID, essentially multiplexing differently tagged packets into `wan` which then seperates them out on `wan.1` `wan.2` `wan.3` and `wan.4` on the ESPRESSObin, and what Babel sees are seperate network interfaces as if the ESPRESSObin has 4 `wan` ports.

1. Connect to the GS305E default IP and login to the admin interface

1. Enable `Basic 802.1Q VLAN Status` then configure the following VLAN ID settings:

    | port    | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
    |:--------|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
    | VLAN ID | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |all|

1. Apply the configurations, then wait 30 seconds to ensure the changes are saved

1. Connect `port 5` to the ESPRESSObin `wan` port, and use the VLAN tagged ports for point-to-point radios or ethernet cables that are connect mesh nodes

1. If this is an Internet Gatway node, connect your Internet backhaul to `port 4` (since we have `wan.4` configured to be the Internet route for Internet Gateway ESPRESSObins)
