Mesh Network Equipment
======================

We are expecting to set up 6-8 _Mesh Nodes_ depending on the area of coverage, which we will not know until early-July when registration level will tell us how far out the camp sites will spread.

A Mesh Node consists of:

- A router
- One, or more, point-to-point (PTP) radios to reach other Mesh Nodes
- One, or more, access point (AP) that is an omnidirectional (indoor or outdoor) or sector antenna for client devices (e.g. phone or computers) to connect to

All routers are ESPRESSObin devices running [Babel](https://github.com/jech/babeld) and Mesh Nodes with more than one PTP radio will also need a managed switch to VLAN tag the traffic.

Three or more of the Mesh Nodes will also have a PoE switch where wired access to the network will be possible. Projects are expected to connect devices running local services (e.g. Matrix) to these switch ports.

The following is a listing of our equipment inventory.
