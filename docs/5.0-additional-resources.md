## 5.0 Additional Resources

This section contains important project resources that don't fit into the above sections.

[5.1 Application Testnet](5.1-application-testnet.html) contains software that allows application developers to use two Raspberry Pis to emulate the mesh network environment. This was useful for developers to test their applications prior to arriving to the experimental network.

[5.2 Hardware Inventory](5.2-hardware-inventory.html) contains a list of hardware used and budget information. The only items that are not tracked on this list that made up part of the network are Internet backhaul equipment provided by the venue and Internet Service Provider, and standard network switches brought to Camp by participants.

[5.3 Graphic Assets](5.3-graphic-assets.html) contains high-res digital art created by various designers at Camp for the purpose of the mesh network project.

[5.4 Photo Gallery](gallery/2019/) contains photos taken by various Camp participants that are related to setting up of the mesh network. Some of the photos are captioned and available on [ImageSnippets](http://www.imagesnippets.com/imgtag/main?q=Dweb_2019_Mesh_Network&existingValue=false). You can find many more general photos about the event at Internet Archive's [DWeb Camp 2019 Collection](https://archive.org/details/dwebcamp2019).
