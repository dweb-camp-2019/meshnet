## 3.0 Social Experience

One of the most important goals, and experimental component, of the participatory network is the social experience of building a network together. This is captured in one of our design goals:

>Allow Camp participants to extend or run locally-hosted services on the network

From the beginning, not only did we want many people to participate in building and maintaining of the network, we also hoped people would run local applications on it. Throughout different phases of this project, many people contributed their skills, hardware, art, experience, and other forms of labour and support.

Section 3 documents the experience during planning phases and throughout the event.
